# Caesar Cipher Web Application

This project is a simple web application that implements a Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm using Python and Flask. The web interface allows users to input text and a shift key, and it provides the encrypted text based on the Caesar Cipher method.

## Features

- **Encrypt text**: Users can input text and a shift key to get the encrypted result.
- **Support for uppercase and lowercase letters**: The cipher handles both cases.
- **Preserves special characters**: Punctuation and spaces remain unchanged.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The backend logic is implemented in Python.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python that serves the web pages and handles form submissions.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vrana710/caesar-cipher-web-app.git
   cd caesar-cipher-web-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip3 install flask
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

2. **Open a web browser and navigate to:**

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

   You should see the Caesar Cipher web application interface.

## Usage

1. **Enter the text** you want to encrypt in the "Enter the text to encrypt" input field.
2. **Enter the shift key** (an integer value) in the "Enter the shift key" input field.
3. **Click the "Encrypt" button** to see the encrypted text displayed on the page.
